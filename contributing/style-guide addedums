# Those are my recommendations on top of the Angular Style guide:

In random order, as they pop into mind, and all are open for discussion.

* Every sample should be in its own lazy-loaded route. (create with `npx ng generate module mySampleName --routing mySampleRoute --module app`)
* inputs and outputs should be limited to max 5. (when there are more, the component at had has too many responsibilities)
* same for DI, do not inject more than 5 things. (when needing more, consider a service that aggregates it into 1 service
* prettier all the things.
* eslint all the things. (we will provide some reasonable default there)
* I'm not sure, but perhaps demand a unit test? But that might scare beginners of off contributing.
* for beginners, everything in a CLI monorepo. We can have multiple projects in there. (libraries/etc)
* for experts the same, but perhaps with NX/lerna? Although I do have some doubts about this. ~(let me explain, those things are actually tooling that has little to nothing to do with Angular, although they are related)~
