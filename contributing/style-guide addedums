# Those are my recomendations on top ot the Angular Style guide:

In random order, as they pop into mind, an all are open for discussion.

* Every sample should be in its own lazy-loaded route. (create with `npx ng genereate module mySampleName --routing mySampleRoute --module app`)
* inputs and outputs should be limited to max 5. (when there are more, the component at had has too many responsebilities)
* same for DI, do not inject more as 5 things. (when needing more, considder an service that argates it into 1 service
* prettier all the things.
* eslint all the things. (we will provide some reasonable default there)
* Im not sure, but perhaps demand a unit test? but that migth scare beginners of off contributing.
* for beginners everything in a CLI monorepo. We can have multiple projects in there. (libraries/etc)
* for experts the same, but perhaps with NX/lerna? Altough I do have some doubts around this. (let me explain, those things are actually tooling that has little to nothing to do with Angular, although they are related)
