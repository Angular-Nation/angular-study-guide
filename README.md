# angular-study-plan

A graded list of topics you'll need to learn to be a professional Angular developer with an opinionated, curated list of links to study materials.

Note 1: Please don't expect your promotional links for study material to be part of this, but do feel free to submit PRs with your recommendations - we will review them and respond even if we don't accept them. We welcome contributions and feedback.

Note 2: This is still under construction.
