# Design Patterns

The book, [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) (by 'The Gang of Four'), was written in 1994 - but is still considered the industry standard. Which by any software standard is amazing.

Several other publishers / authors have tried to displace it with their own more up to date concepts, but it's not possible without repeating most of it.

If you were lucky enough to do a Computer Science degree, you've likely encountered and been bored by it. It's a dry but extremely clever read.

If you study enough of it, you'll realise that the Angular framework implements several Design Patterns listed in the book (for example, Factories and Singletons are Dependency Injection and Angular Services). You'll also hopefully realise that if you go on to try to implement many Design Patterns yourself whilst coding in Angular, you'll likely be stepping outside of the framework and therefore be working against the patterns intended for you to use in Angular. That's not to say you can't use any of them, it's just you need to be aware.
