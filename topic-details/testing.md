# Testing

Testing is extremely important part of being a web developer. Angular treats testing as a major part of the platform and
makes it easy to get started adding and running tests to your project.
Unfortunately, while Angular makes adding and running tests easy, it doesn't make it easy to know
what to test and when to write tests. Hopefully these links help you learn more about writing tests.

Karma and Jasmine are the official Angular libraries required for unit testing. The links below contain test examples in Jasmine.
