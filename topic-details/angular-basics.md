# Angular Basics

The basics of Angular can be divided up into four main areas, Component, Templates, Services and Modules.

Components and Templates are used to make the UI elements of an Angular app. Services are used to share common functionality 
between components and handle business domain logic of your app. Modules are a mechanism for
grouping areas of functionality together. For example, you may have a Shopping Cart module in your application
which contains all the Components/Templates and Services for that Shopping cart.
