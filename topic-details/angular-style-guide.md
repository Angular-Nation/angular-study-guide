# Angular Style Guide

The [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) is for developers at all levels but it is a very dry read.

Most developers don't find the drive to read all the way through it until they reach senior level. Your work quality and your team's approval approval of you will greatly improve the sooner you read it. Most of the concepts in it are not difficult to understand at junior level.

The main problem with the Style Guide is that a significant portion of it spends time describing the importance of the naming convention in files that the Angular CLI already generates for you. I firmly believe they should provide a summary rule and a shortcut past those sections saying, 'Don't mess with the naming convention of what the Angular CLI gives you - we did it on purpose so you can organise your work better.'

Everything else in the guide is awesome, and you should do it because a lot of clever people spent a lot of time coming up with those rules to help you write cleaner, more understandable code.
